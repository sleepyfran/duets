# Duets ðŸŽ¸

Duets will be a music simulation focused on allowing the player to be the leader of their own band, composing songs and making gigs to become a star.

# ðŸ›  Run it locally

Duets is built with F# as an interactive CLI game. Start by cloning the repository and entering in it:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sleepyfran/duets.git
cd duets
```

Once you have it, you can either chose to run it with a local installation of the .NET SDK or, if you prefer, through Docker to avoid installing the SDK on your computer and instead running the game inside a container.

## Running with local .NET

If you have .NET already on your computer or you want to install it, follow the instructions [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) to get the latest version of .NET. Once you have it, you can simply run:

```bash
dotnet build
dotnet run --project src/Cli/Cli.fsproj
```

## Running with Docker

You can also run the game with Docker by using these commands:

```bash
docker build -t duets .
docker run -it duets
```

# ðŸ§ª Testing

You can run the tests with:

```bash
dotnet test
```

# ðŸ˜„ Contributions

Right now the game is in concept phase and it'll probably change quickly until it has certain features so there's no public roadmap. The best way of contributing right now is running the game and reporting bugs, if you want to contribute to the code check the project a little bit later, I'll update this section as soon as it's possible to have external contributions!
