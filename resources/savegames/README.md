# Test savegames

This folder contains all the test savegames that I am using while developing. Some might be completely random, some might attempt to re-create real bands to see what the results end up being and some test a specific scenario of the game.

I will try as hard as possible to keep all these updated as they get broken by changes, but in case I leave one outdated they'll have the `.old` suffix attached to them. So feel free to use any of these if you'd like to experience the game without having to start from the beginning.

## Organization

Each savegame is inside a folder that describes the current situation (free roam, in-concert, etc.) and the specific test scenario that the savegame contains.
